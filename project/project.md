# Project Activity: Insert data in mySQL from the tab-separated value file

## Objective

Automate the data insertion process in mySQL from the tab-separated value file using Java

## Pre-requisite

- Review the [Databases](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/databases/Lecture.html) lecture.
- Perform the [practice lab](https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/databases/Practice-lab.md).
- 
## Data set
- [Auto MPG data](https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/project/auto-mpg.data-original)
- [Data set details](https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/project/auto-mpg.names)

## Task
- Manipulate the record in the already created database __Miramar__ and the table __Student__.
- Insert a record using the J connector; access the database and use SQL query inside the Java. Use the following data.
```
SSN:          111222333
First name:   Philip
Middle name:  David Charles
Last name:    Collins
DOB:          Jan 30, 1951
Street:       NA
Phone:        NA
Zipcode:      NA
deptID:       1234
```
- Update a record and change zip code to 92126

## What to submit?
  
1. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? **(2 marks)**.  
2. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. **(8 marks)**

## How to submit it?

- Upload your work in the .pdf or .txt format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java or .txt extensions.
- Do not compress or zip files.

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (8+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
