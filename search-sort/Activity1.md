# Activity: Insertion sort

## Objective

Write a code and implement insertion sort

## Pre-requisite

Review the [Search and sort lecture](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/java/blob/main/search-sort/Lecture.html)

## Task
- Read the size of an integer array, followed by the elements of the array (no duplicates).
- Output the array.
- Perform an insertion sort on the array.
- Output the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

__Expected input__

`6 3 2 1 5 9 8`

__Expected output__

```
3 2 1 5 9 8

2 3 1 5 9 8
1 2 3 5 9 8
1 2 3 5 9 8
1 2 3 5 9 8
1 2 3 5 8 9

comparisons: 7
swaps: 4
```

## What to submit?
  
1. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? **(2 marks)**.  
2. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. **(8 marks)**

## How to submit it?

- Upload your work in the .pdf or .txt format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java or .txt extensions.
- Do not compress or zip files.

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
