# Memory management

## Objective
Understand how memory management works in Java

## Pre-requisite
Review "Memory management"

## Task A (using classes)
Create your own class which performs a certain task. Use main() to create an object of the class. You can also use any past object and classes
examples.

## Expected output
The code and the mapping of each variable and object into "Stack and Heap". Make sure to show how garbage collector works on the code.
You can draw "Stack and Heap" on paper or on a computer. Your choice.

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 mark).  
3. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. (6 marks)

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in the .pdf format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java extension.

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
