# Activity: Collections

## Objective

Identify palindrome and implement deque 

## Pre-requisite

Review the "Collections" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. Use a deque to implement a program that tests whether a line of text is a palindrome. 
The program reads a line, then outputs whether the input is a palindrome or not.

__Expected input__

senile felines!

__Expected output__

Yes, "senile felines!" is a palindrome.

**Expected input**

```
-3850
```

**Expected output**

```
Exception: Negative step count entered.
```

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. **(2 marks).**   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? **(2 marks)**.  
3. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. **(6 marks)**

## How to submit it?

- Upload your work in the .pdf or .txt format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java or .txt extensions.
- Do not compress or zip files.

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
