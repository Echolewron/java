# Activity: Collections

## Objective

Identify palindrome and implement using deque 

## Pre-requisite

Review the "Collections" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. Write a code which uses deque and tests whether a line of text is a palindrome. 
The program reads a line, then outputs whether the input is a palindrome or not.

__Expected input__

senile felines!

__Expected output__

Yes, "senile felines!" is a palindrome.

__Expected input__

rotostor

__Expected output__

No, "rotostor" is not a palindrome.

>**Note:** Ignore punctuation and spacing. Assume all alphabetic characters will be lowercase.
>
>Special case: A one-character string is a palindrome.
>
>Hint: The deque must be a Deque of Characters, but ordinary chars will be automatically converted to Characters when added to the deque.

## What to submit?
  
1. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? **(2 marks)**.  
2. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. **(8 marks)**

## How to submit it?

- Upload your work in the .pdf or .txt format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java or .txt extensions.
- Do not compress or zip files.

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
