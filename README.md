# Introduction to objects
## Grouping things into objects
The physical world comprises material items like wood, metal, plastic, fabric, etc. To keep the world understandable, people deal with higher-level objects, like chairs, tables, and TV's. Those objects are groupings of lower-level items.

Likewise, a program is made up of items like variables and methods. To keep programs understandable, programmers often deal with higher-level groupings of those items known as objects. In programming, an object is a grouping of data (variables) and operations that can be performed on that data (methods).
