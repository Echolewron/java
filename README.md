# Introduction to objects
## Grouping things into objects
The physical world comprises material items like wood, metal, plastic, fabric, etc. To keep the world understandable, people deal with higher-level objects, like chairs, tables, and TV's. Those objects are groupings of lower-level items.

Likewise, a program is made up of items like variables and methods. To keep programs understandable, programmers often deal with higher-level groupings of those items known as objects. In programming, an object is a grouping of data (variables) and operations that can be performed on that data (methods).

## Abstraction
Abstraction means to have a user interact with an item at a high-level, with lower-level internal details hidden from the user (aka information hiding or encapsulation). Ex: An oven supports an abstraction of a food compartment and a knob to control heat. An oven's user need not interact with the internal parts of an oven.

Objects strongly support abstraction, hiding entire groups of methods and variables and exposing only certain methods to a user.

An abstract data type (ADT) is a data type whose creation and update are constrained to specific well-defined operations. A class can be used to implement an ADT.
