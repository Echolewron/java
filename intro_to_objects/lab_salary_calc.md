# Calculate salary using classes

## Objective

## Pre-requisite
Review "Introduction to objects & classes"

## Task to perform
The program below uses a class, TaxTableTools, which has a tax table built in. The main method prompts for a salary, then uses a TaxTableTools method to get the tax rate. The program then calculates the tax to pay and displays the results to the user. Run the program with annual salaries of 10000, 50000, 50001, 100001 and -1 (to end the program) and note the output tax rate and tax to pay.

Modify the TaxTableTools class to use a setter method that accepts a new salary and tax rate table.
Modify the program to call the new method, and run the program again, noting the same output.
